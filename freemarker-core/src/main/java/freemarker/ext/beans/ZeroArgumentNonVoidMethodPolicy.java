    /**
     * Both {@code obj.m}, and {@code obj.m()} gives back the value that the {@code m} Java method returns, and it's
     * not possible to get the method itself. But, it's not applicable for Java Bean property read methods
     * (like {@code int getX()}), which remain just simple methods (because the Java Bean property is visible regardless
     * of the {@link ZeroArgumentNonVoidMethodPolicy}, like {@code obj.x}, for which the Java Bean property read method
     * is {@link int getX()}).
     *
     * <p>This is a parse-time trick that only works when the result of the dot operator (like {@code obj.m}), or of the
     * square bracket key operator (like {@code obj["m"]}) is called immediately in a template (like {@code obj.m()}, or
     * like {@code obj["m"]()}), and therefore the dot, or square bracket key operator knows that you will call the
     * result of it. In such case, if the {@linkplain ObjectWrapper wrapped} {@code obj} implements
     * {@link MethodCallAwareTemplateHashModel}, the operator will call
     * {@link MethodCallAwareTemplateHashModel#getBeforeMethodCall(String)} instead of
     * {@link TemplateHashModel#get(String)}. Also note that at least in 2.3.33 it's only done if the method call has
     * 0 arguments.
     *
     * <p>The practical reason for this feature is that the convention of using {@code SomeType something()} instead
     * of {@code SomeType getSomething()} spreads in the Java ecosystem (and is a standard in some other JVM languages),
     * and thus we can't tell anymore if {@code SomeType something()} just reads a value, and hence should be accessed
     * like {@code obj.something}, or it's more like an operation that has side effect, and therefore should be
     * accessed like {@code obj.something()}. So with allowing both, the template author is free to decide which is
     * the more fitting. Also, for accessing Java records components, the proper way is {@code obj.something}, but
     * before FreeMarker was aware of records (and hence that those methods are like property read methods), the
     * only way that worked was {@code obj.something()}, so to be more backward compatible, we have to support both.
